Meetings Plugin
===============

WordPress plugin for maintaining database of meetings and locations. Has address standardization features.

Notes
-----

* it's best to use Chrome, because then the time field will be nicest
* Notes is for any non-standardized info, such as Big Book Study, or Building C
* Location should be a simple place-name, eg Queen of the Valley Hospital
* Address should only be address, no "Upstairs" or "Building C" or "Near 2nd Ave"
* You can fill in a very basic address and then when you leave that field you will see it try to standardize the address for you. it means you write "1000 trancas, napa" and it will come back with "1000 Trancas Street, Napa, CA 94558, USA"
